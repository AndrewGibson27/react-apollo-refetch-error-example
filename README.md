In reference to [`apollo-client`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) ticket.

## The problem
Refetching a query in `componentDidMount` whose resolver throws an error
does not result in that error appearing in `props.data.error`. That value
seems to always be undefined.

## Run the app
+ `yarn`
+ `yarn start`
+ Go to `http://localhost:3000`
+ Open the browser console

## Files of note, including inline comments
